   ](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
3. Check your __VS Code__ version:  
   `code --version # should be '1.79.0' or greater`

## Steps to build this demo

1. Follow the steps in [the Alpha 0 README's 'Steps to build this demo'
   ](https://github.com/not-timid/a0#steps-to-build-this-demo)
2. Find and replace `Alpha 0` to `Alpha 1`, `a0` to `a1`, and `0.0.0` to `0.0.1`
3. Change the `description` to fit the intent of this repo
4. `npm run build`, test locally, commit and push to GitHub
5. Once GitHub Pages has deployed, find and replace `a0` to `a1` in
   [the apex landing-page](https://github.com/not-timid/not-timid.github.io)
6. Commit and push not-timid.github.io, and after Pages has deployed check that
   <https://not-timid.com/> is redirecting to <https://not-timid.com/a1/>
7. The visual transition should be smooth, so you may need to update the style,
   layout and content of not-timid.github.io
